Elon Musk News: DOGE Leader Is Leaving the Trump Administration
Elon Musk is stepping down from his government role as a top adviser to President Donald Trump. The Tesla CEO, who spearheaded cost-cutting efforts for the Department of Government Efficiency initiative, announced his departure in an X post on May 28.

“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote on his social media site. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”

Musk’s role in the Trump administration was always a temporary one, and he had already scaled back his work with DOGE in April to focus more on Tesla. Still, his departure comes just one day after the 53-year-old criticized the president’s tax and spending legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In an interview with CBS News, Musk said the bill “undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing” by increasing the federal deficit.

He also told The Washington Post that DOGE had become the government’s “whipping boy,” claiming that the agency was being blamed for actions beyond its control. “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” Musk said.

Prior to resigning, the DOGE advisor had trouble achieving the spending cuts he initially promised. Instead of cutting “at least $2 trillion,” he reduced that target by half before lowering the benchmark again to $150 billion.

Who Is Elon Musk?
Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, among other companies. Their success has propelled him to become the richest person in the world, with a net worth greater than $386 billion. The South African–born entrepreneur started his first businesses in the 1990s: an online city guide called Zip2 and a digital payment company named X.com, which later became PayPal. Musk, who became an American citizen in 2002, then moved into the transportation industry via his most recognizable companies. He diversified his holdings in 2022 by purchasing Twitter, which he renamed X. A vehement supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, Musk was head of the Department of Government Efficiency, the headline-grabbing advisory group under Trump’s second administration, before announcing his departure in May 2025. Beyond his professional life, Musk is a father to 14 kids. Where Is Elon Musk From?
Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a CoverGirl campaign. When Elon was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Elon’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer.

Elon spent his early childhood with his brother, Kimbal, and sister, Tosca, in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.

Around this time, Musk developed an interest in computers and taught himself how to program. When he was 12 years old, Musk developed his own game called Blastar that he sold for $500. He was often so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.

The short, introverted, and bookish child was bullied until he was 15. By that point, he went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling. He has continued to practice martial arts as an adult.

At age 17, in 1988, Elon moved to Canada against his parents’ wishes to attend university and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. He obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain U.S. citizenship via that path. Elon moved to the United States a few years later and officially became an American citizen in 2002.

“I came to North America because I felt this was where there was opportunity to do great things in technology,” he said in 2013.
Education
Musk’s move to Canada coincided with his enrollment in Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. He studied there for two years before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. He graduated five years later with bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics.

Musk then headed to Stanford University to pursue a doctorate in energy physics. However, his relocation to California was timed perfectly with the internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days in favor of joining the rising tech wave.
