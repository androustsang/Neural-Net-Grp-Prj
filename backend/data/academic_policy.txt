Students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity at all times. Academic work must reflect a student’s own learning, understanding, and effort. Any attempt to gain an unfair academic advantage is considered misconduct.

Forms of Academic Misconduct include:
• Plagiarism — presenting another person’s words, ideas, code, images, or solutions as your own without proper acknowledgement.
• Unauthorized collaboration — working with others on assignments, labs, or assessments when individual work is required.
• Cheating on tests — using unauthorized materials, devices, notes, websites, or AI tools during quizzes, tests, or exams.
• Fabrication — falsifying data, research results, citations, attendance, or any academic information.
• Copying or sharing work — distributing solutions, screenshots, code, or completed work to other students.
• Submitting work generated entirely by AI tools without disclosure or permission.

Responsibilities of Students:
• Complete all work honestly and to the best of their ability.
• Ask the instructor if unsure whether collaboration or use of AI tools is allowed.
• Properly cite any sources used, including textbooks, websites, or external references.
• Protect their work and ensure it is not accessible for others to copy.

Consequences of Misconduct:
Academic misconduct may result in penalties such as:
• A grade of zero on the assessment
• A failing grade in the course
• A written warning or academic integrity record
• Suspension or further disciplinary action in serious or repeated cases

Use of AI Tools:
AI tools may be permitted for some activities, provided the instructor explicitly allows their use. If AI tools are used, students must follow course-specific rules (e.g., limit to brainstorming, not generating full solutions) and disclose usage when required.

Where to Get Help:
Students should contact their professor, program coordinator, or academic advisor if they have questions about expectations or need clarification before submitting their work.
