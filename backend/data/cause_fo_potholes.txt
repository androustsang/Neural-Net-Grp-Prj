Potholes are created when water penetrates the top layer of asphalt through cracks in the road. After the moisture freezes and expands, sections of the pavement are forced up. The weight of vehicles going over this section of road breaks the pavement and the asphalt is forced out. Potholes are more frequent in the spring, after the freeze/thaw action following winter.

The total number of potholes repaired could vary year-over-year dependent on winter conditions. If it is freezing all through the winter, fewer potholes are likely to form due to less number of freeze-thaw cycles. But a milder winter will have higher number of freeze-thaw cycles where temperature falls below freezing and then quickly rises above freezing resulting in more potholes in that year.
