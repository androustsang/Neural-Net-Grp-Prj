Repairing potholes is an affordable way to maintain our roads. Our crews routinely monitor road conditions and identify areas that need repairs.

Crews place asphalt and rake it into the pothole. Then they tamp down the asphalt and smooth it out until the road surface is improved. The job takes 15-20 minutes.

During winter months when temperatures are low and pavement is covered with snow/ice, it is extremely difficult to work with hot asphalt because it cools very quickly. Potholes are temporarily patched with cold mix asphalt to make the road safe. More permanent repairs are performed with hot asphalt when warmer conditions prevail.

Road users and business owners can help by reporting potholes when you see them. Crews will repair potholes within four days of it being reported
